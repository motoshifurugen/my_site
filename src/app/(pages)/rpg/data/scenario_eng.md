Blue Leaf: Scenario
Chapter 1: The Correct Daily Routine
Scene 1
The path from the station to the office is the same every morning. The timing of the traffic lights, the strength of the wind blowing between the skyscrapers—everything falls within the scope of my predictions. To me, "correctness" is reproducibility. If the conditions are met, the result can be recreated. Correct procedures. Correct judgments. As long as you don't deviate from them, you won't make a major mistake. As the office building comes into view, I check my watch once. 8:50 AM. "On schedule, as always."

Scene 2
The floor in the morning is as quiet as a sterile room. The sound of typing is scattered like dry raindrops. A balanced space with no room for emotion. Suddenly, that silence is shattered. "Good morning everyone!" A voice bright enough to be out of place. Standing at the entrance was Irone Aoba. A newcomer who joined this year, she is a foreign object that changes the atmosphere of the floor in an instant. Aoba isn't fast at her job. In fact, she's slow. Her efficiency is poor. Instead, she always speaks up when someone makes a mistake, and when the air gets heavy, she starts talking about the trivial weather. It can't be explained by logic, but the environment doesn't crumble because of her. She is an incomprehensible anomaly. "Good morning, Mr. Akabane!" She stops in front of my desk, her voice bouncing. I can feel the surrounding air loosen slightly. "...Morning." I reply without taking my eyes off the monitor. "I've summarized yesterday's documents up to this point!" Aoba holds out a folder. I look through the contents. The direction is right, but the structure is full of waste. "...If you had used the template first, it would have been more than enough and much faster." Aoba blinked for a moment. "Oh, I see! I'll do that next time!" Lighthearted. I returned the file without saying anything more.

Scene 3
After the afternoon meeting, I suddenly remembered a project from a few years ago. There were no dissenting opinions. It was just a method everyone wasn't used to. Follow the new rules. Don't bring in unnecessary emotions. By proceeding with the determined steps without wasting time, the numbers came out clean. It's not that I argued anyone down. I simply understood the rules of society and adapted to them. And so, it worked. "...The same today," I muttered quietly, returning my gaze to the monitor. The world is as beautiful as a mathematical formula—as long as you remove the noise.

Scene 4
At night, I went into the usual izakaya with my colleague, Toya Kise. "A beer for now. And potato salad." "You really never go on an adventure, do you?" "What's that supposed to mean?" "It's been five years since we started coming here, and your first words are always 'potato salad.' Try the 'Today's Special' for once." Kise fans himself with the menu. "Wasting time on a bad draw is pointless." "That 'waste' is what makes the drink taste better, you know." "I don't follow your logic." I put a bite of the potato salad into my mouth. The usual taste. This is fine. Obtaining the expected result—that is my security.

Chapter 2: Unnecessary Senses
Scene 1
Lunch break. The company cafeteria was filled with air carrying the dampness characteristic of a rainy day. "Doesn't the rain smell interesting today?" Aoba said, leaning forward slightly. "The scent of soil is so strong... it feels kind of comforting." (Petrichor...) A phenomenon where an aerosol is created by substances produced by plant oils and bacteria when rain falls on dry asphalt or soil, generating a unique scent. I can explain the chemical mechanism. But it has absolutely zero relevance to work. "...I see." Around us, several colleagues were naturally listening to Aoba. "I get it." "It is kind of calming, isn't it?" "Having Aoba-chan around really softens the mood." Soften. I cannot understand that ambiguous evaluation. Even if the mood is softened, operational efficiency doesn't go up. The numbers don't move. Watching the scene from a step back, I was reconstructing the afternoon schedule in my head. Time flows slowly only around her. To an organization, that should be nothing but a "lag."

Scene 2
In the afternoon, a trouble report came in. Apparently, an inquiry about a delivery date had come from a client Aoba was handling. "Aoba." "I saw the email to the client. You wrote, 'I will respond as quickly as possible.'" "Yes! I wanted to put them at ease, even just a little." "Don't." "Eh?" "'As quickly as possible' creates arbitrary expectations for the other party. If you're even a day late, they'll feel betrayed." I point at the monitor. "Business doesn't need 'kindness.' It needs a 'precise commitment.' Instead of making an uncertain promise, true sincerity is giving a definite delivery date and letting the client decide." Aoba's face lit up with realization. "...I just wanted them to be happy... but that was actually irresponsible of me." "Exactly. Don't work based on your emotions. It becomes a risk." "Yes... I'm sorry." Aoba's back as she returned to her desk looked a size smaller than usual.

Scene 3
Night. The same shop. The same seat. "Ah, I got dumped again." Kise grumbles while fiddling with his phone. "What was it this time?" "She said, 'I can't even breathe when I'm with you.'" "I planned the date course perfectly, you know? The travel time, the restaurant reservation, the movie showtime. The shortest route for the most efficient fun." I tilt my glass. "What's wrong with that? It's perfect." "Right? But she said, 'I wanted to enjoy the time we spent getting lost.'" Kise tosses an edamame shell. "I guess taking the 'correct route' isn't necessarily a fun date. Humans are a pain." I stopped moving for a moment at those words. Humans are a pain. That's exactly why I stick to thorough manuals at work. So we don't get lost. That shouldn't be wrong.

Chapter 3: The Cost of Optimization
Scene 1
Morning. I walk the path from the station to the office at the same speed as yesterday. Everything is as expected. No delays. No problems. As I make that judgment, for some reason, my steps feel heavy. My tie feels tighter than usual.

Scene 2
When I arrived at the office, Aoba was already in her seat. The hands hitting the keyboard were significantly faster than before. Peeking at the screen, ambiguous expressions had vanished, replaced by facts and figures arranged in perfect order. "Good morning, Mr. Akabane." Her voice is bright. But it's thin. A constant tone, like a recorded message. "Morning." There is no problem. In fact, it's ideal. —And yet.

Scene 3
I noticed that the small potted plant by Aoba's desk was gone before I knew it. (...She cleaned it up.) Rational. It's better not to keep things unnecessary for work. I should have concluded that, but my gaze kept returning to that empty space.

Scene 4
Afternoon regular meeting. The materials Aoba summarized are projected on the screen. No waste. The points are clear, and risk hedging is perfect. "Good. The numerical backing is solid." The boss nods with satisfaction. "This is the result of Akabane's guidance." I bow my head slightly. "...It's her own hard work." Aoba also continues her explanation calmly while taking notes. She doesn't throw in digressions like before. She doesn't stop talking to worry about someone's expression. The meeting ended five minutes early. Efficient. Impeccable. And yet. The sound of applause sounded so far away.

Scene 5
Returning to my desk, I open an email from Aoba. Subject. Body. Signature. Everything is perfectly in order. There isn't a single extra sentence anywhere. "Thank you for your hard work. I am sending today's minutes. Please review them." Before, there would have been a "noise-like" sentence here, like "It's cold today, isn't it?" or "I was nervous about the meeting." Those were all things I deemed "unnecessary." (I...) Right then, I understood clearly. My "correctness" had painted over Aoba's colors. I didn't yell at her. I didn't deny her. I simply continued to present the "correct way" quietly and robbed her of her "self." This isn't growth. It's optimization. I optimized a human being to function as part of a system. As a result, she was reshaped into my image.

Scene 6
Drinking with Kise at night, I was the one to speak up. "...The training for the newcomer is over." "Oh, finally? She was a handful, wasn't she?" Kise asks while squeezing lemon over fried chicken. "Yeah. ...She's become perfect. No mistakes. No idle chatter. She moves exactly as I tell her." "Heh, that's great. So your copy-robot is complete, huh?" Kise laughs without malice. "Work will be easier now. Cheers." The sound of glasses clinking echoes. "...Yeah." I drink the beer. It had no taste. Copy-robot. Kise's lighthearted remark sticks in my ear and won't leave. Is this really what I wanted to create? I shaved off her personality, coated her with "correctness," and gave her the same "function" as me. That is a success. But looking at Kise laughing like an idiot in the next seat, I couldn't help but feel that I, who was supposed to be "complete," was terribly defective.

Chapter 4: The Room with Thin Oxygen
Scene 1
Morning. Walking the path from the station to the office, I loosened my tie slightly. Lately, my breathing has been shallow. The oxygen shouldn't be thin, but I have a sensation that it's not reaching the depths of my lungs.

Scene 2
When I enter the office, Aoba is already in her seat. "Good morning, Mr. Akabane." A greeting without a hair's breadth of error. Perfect vocalization. (—Copy-robot.) "Morning." I take my seat. The sound of typing echoes regularly. The noise I once found unpleasant had completely vanished. Quiet, efficient, no waste. (...Is this the silence I created?)

Scene 3
During the morning, Aoba brings documents. "Please check these." A word without waste. A movement without waste. I look through the materials. The content is fine. The structure and numbers are correct. ...Correct. And yet. "Aoba." When I call out, Aoba stops immediately. "Yes." For a moment, I am at a loss for words. (What do I want to confirm?) There are no typos. The logic isn't broken. Even so, Something that used to be here is nowhere to be found. "...No, never mind." Aoba nods after a short pause and returns to her seat.

Scene 4
Lunch break. Cafeteria. Aoba is sitting next to a colleague. The conversation is about work progress, task management, and deadlines. There's no trivial small talk like before. "Aoba-chan, you've gotten so much faster at work." "Thank you. Thanks to Mr. Akabane's training, the waste has decreased." Those words pierce my chest. "Waste." The name of what I have been cutting away. Aoba's expression is calm. No dissatisfaction, no anger. That makes it even more painful. (She doesn't realize she's broken.) Or— Maybe she realized it and simply accepted it.

Scene 5
Night. Drinking with Kise again. "Something's up with you," Kise says quietly while picking at edamame. "You look like Tomoya after he lost Nagisa." "What?" "Did you mess up at work or something?" I set my glass down. "Everything's smooth. Aoba has grown. The team numbers are good." "Then that's good. But maybe you should have a team drinking party or something? People in other departments were saying, 'That place is like the military, it's hard to approach.'" "I hate people who try to solve team communication issues with drinking parties the most." When I replied instantly, Kise laughed. "You just made an enemy of everyone in this shop." "Well, but since the numbers are coming out, I can't say anything."

Chapter 5: Beyond the Manual
Scene 1
In this negotiation, there was a request for an in-person meeting, which has become rare lately. Aoba and I head to the client's office in a company car. "You have the flow in your head?" "Yes. I will lead the progression, and you will provide technical support. The Q&A is also perfect." Aoba shows me her tablet. The counterpart this time is Mr. Sasaki, the HR Manager. He's the practical type who likes numbers. "If it's Mr. Sasaki, he'll definitely bite on this cost-cutting plan. No need to appeal to unnecessary emotions. Let's just present the benefits calmly." "Understood." If we move according to the manual, there's no factor for failure. We arrived at our destination with the "correct answer" prepared.

Scene 2
The reception room we were shown into. The one waiting was not Mr. Sasaki. "Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting." An older man walked in. He wore a high-quality suit loosely, a gentle smile on his face, but his eyes were sharp. "I'm Saegusa, the Senior Managing Director. Sasaki had a sudden health issue. I'll listen in his place." Saegusa. One of the founding members of this company from my research. He is the type I am worst at dealing with—someone who grew the company through "intuition" and "character" rather than "rationality." "N-Nice to meet you. My name is Aoba." Aoba shows a moment of agitation. An unexpected situation. I let out a small breath and signal her to stay calm. (Don't be rattled. Even if the person changes, the correct business answer doesn't. Overwhelm him with numbers.)

Scene 3
The presentation begins. Aoba's speaking style is fluent. However, Director Saegusa hardly looks at the materials. He is simply staring intently at Aoba's face. "—Based on the above, your company's expenses can be reduced by 15% annually." Aoba finishes the explanation. Silence. Director Saegusa slowly took off his glasses. "...It's a beautiful presentation." "Impeccable. You've studied well." "T-Thank you very much." "So?" Mr. Saegusa continues while maintaining his gentle smile. "What do you think?" "Eh...?" "Do you truly believe, in your own heart, that the people on the ground will be happy with this plan?" The question was quiet. But the air in the room suddenly became thin. Aoba is at a loss for words. A question that isn't in the manual. I grip the pen in my hand. This is a test. A test of what lies beneath our armor of "efficiency."

(Branch Choice Here)

Chapter 6: The 100-Point Hell
Scene 1
Aoba's gaze wanders. She looks at me. I nod wordlessly. (Don't say anything unnecessary. Reply with logic.) Aoba tightens her expression. Killing her emotions, she speaks the "correct answer." "...Yes. I am certain that for the people on the ground, operational efficiency will lead to long-term benefits. I believe future figures should be prioritized over temporary burdens." A perfect answer. As a business matter, nothing is wrong.

Scene 2
Mr. Saegusa looked at Aoba for a few seconds. He showed neither disappointment nor anger. "I see." "I understand well. ...Thank you for coming while you're busy." Mr. Saegusa stands up. "Eh, um, about the contract..." "I'll have Sasaki contact you later." Behind us, only the sound of the door closing echoed. Rejection. A rejection deeper and colder than being yelled at. He didn't need to say, "Your company has no heart." We were quietly judged as "unnecessary."

Scene 3
"...It should have been a perfect answer." On the way back, Aoba mutters. "It was," I reply. We probably won't get the contract. But our method isn't wrong. What was wrong was the other party's emotional judgment criteria. I try to justify it to myself, but my throat is parched as if it's burning. Aoba, walking beside me, is no longer agitated. "Next time, I'll prepare materials that exclude emotional arguments even further." Watching her say that calmly, I realized. From now on, no matter how much we succeed, we will never be able to connect with "humans" like Mr. Saegusa again. A life of chewing sand would continue forever.

→ Bad End

Chapter 6: Fanfare of Noise
Scene 1
Aoba is struggling to answer. Her lips are trembling as she tries to speak the "correct answer." (No.) I have an intuition. That lie won't work on this man. "...Forgive me, Director." I cut across Aoba's words. "The person in charge, Aoba, actually had another concern." Aoba looks at me in surprise. "She visited the sites and summarized the 'risk of lowering staff motivation' behind the efficiency in a report. ...I am the one who rejected it because it 'doesn't turn into numbers.'"

Scene 2
"Oh?" "Aoba. ...That plan I rejected. Just an oral explanation is fine, can you describe it?" When I prompted her, Aoba was flustered for a moment, then immediately turned eyes of resolve toward him. "Y-Yes! ...Actually, the people on the ground said they prefer the current layout and flow of the breakroom, even if it's inefficient..." Aoba begins to speak. A story about the "scent" of the site that doesn't appear in numbers. It wasn't a smart presentation. But I felt Mr. Saegusa's center of gravity lean forward just a little. Confirming that we would receive a reply at a later date, we left the office.

Scene 3
In the end, the deal didn't go through. My boss confronts me. "Why didn't you proceed with the original plan?" I explain. Long-term trust. The "unspoken discomfort" the client felt. My boss left with an unconvinced expression. My evaluation goes down.

Scene 4
Night. Walking side-by-side with Aoba to the station. "...I'm sorry about that." Aoba shakes her head. "I think it was for the best." "Probably, even if that went well, it would have broken later anyway." There's no basis. But Aoba feels that way. For the first time, I think: (Correctness isn't something to be proven after the fact.) Looking up from the station platform, the sky seemed to be shining with more stars than usual.

→ True End

Chapter 6: A Detour with an Ocean View
Scene 1
Against Mr. Saegusa's questioning, Aoba is cornered. "I..." Her hands are trembling. Does she spit out a manual-compliant answer (a lie), or is she branded as incompetent for being unable to answer? Either way, the burden is too heavy for the current Aoba. The mask of the "perfect subordinate" I built is about to peel off. If I let this continue, she will either be decisively hurt or kill her heart and become "complete." (...That's enough.) I made a decision.

Scene 2
"Director Saegusa." I stood up and closed the folder. "I apologize. We will be withdrawing today's proposal." "Mr. Akabane!?" Aoba shouts. Mr. Saegusa also frowns. "What is the meaning of this?" "It's as you pointed out. Our plan lacked consideration for the people on the ground. ...Even if we proceed like this, it won't benefit your company." It is a defeat as a businessman. But it's much better than letting Aoba give a "heart-killing answer." "We will come back another time." I bowed deeply, prompted Aoba, and left the room.

Scene 3
A nearby cafe. After a heavy silence, Aoba speaks. "...I'm sorry. Because I couldn't answer, the deal..." "No, that was for the best." I drink my coffee. It's bitter. "The contract will fall through, I suppose." "Why did you stop me? I could have answered if it was by the manual." "I know." I look at Aoba. "But I felt that if you said that, you'd truly turn into 'that kind of person' for real." "Eh?" "We didn't get the job. My evaluation will drop. ...But you know," I loosened my tie and took a deep breath. Strangely, I had no regrets. "Instead of lying and winning, I'd rather lose and be able to breathe. ...That's how I feel now." Aoba looked at me for a while, but eventually, she relaxed and laughed. "...You're weird, Mr. Akabane." "Shut up." The negotiation was a total failure. However, as we looked out the window, our vision was a little clearer than it had been yesterday.
